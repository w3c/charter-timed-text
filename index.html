      <h2>Scope</h2>

      <p>This group is chartered to develop specifications for the representation of timed text in online media.</p>

      <p>Timed text means text synchronized with other timed media, e.g. audio and video (2D, 3D, 360ยบ, AR and VR), and
      includes captions, subtitles, described video (aka video/audio description), karaoke, etc.</p>

      <p>These specifications are intended to be used from authoring to end-user presentation, and for both prepared
      and live applications.</p>

          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>

          <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title=
          "Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each Recommendation-track Technical Report SHOULD have
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent
          implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the Technical Report.</p>

          <p>Each Recommendation-track Technical Report:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>SHOULD contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web
            authors, and end users.</li>

            <li>SHOULD have an associated testing plan, starting from the earliest drafts.</li>

            <li>SHOULD contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways that
            features defined in the Technical Report can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising
            accessibility in implementations.</li>

            <li>SHOULD address the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media Accessibility User
            Requirements</a>
            </li>

            <li>SHOULD contains a section discussing interoperability with previous versions, if any, of the Technical
            Report, and other relevant specificattions.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>To promote interoperability, all normative changes made to Technical Reports SHOULD have associated

      <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

      <p>To be successful, the Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration,
      including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for
      each specification. The Chairs and specification Editors are expected to contribute half of a working day per
      week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.</p>

      <p>The Working Group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document
      repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>.</p>

      <p>The Working Group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their
      agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="communication">
      <h2>Communication</h2>

      <p id="public">Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from
      teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue
      tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts
      and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and MAY permit direct public
      contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.</p>

      <p>Information about the Working Group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status,
      participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed Text
      Working Group home page</a>.</p>

      <p>Most <a href="https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed Text Working Group</a> teleconferences will focus on
      discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.</p>

      <p>This Working Group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list public-tt@w3.org (<a href=
      "http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-tt/">archive</a>) or <a id="public-github" href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/">GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this
      work.</p>

      <p>The Working Group MAY use a Member-confidential mailing list member-tt@w3.org (<a href=
      "http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-tt/">archive</a>) for administrative purposes and, at the discretion
      of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests
      such a discussion.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="decisions">
      <h2>Decision Policy</h2>

      <p>This Working Group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor
      or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the Working
      Group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>

      <p>However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful
      consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs MAY call for a Working Group vote, and record a
      decision along with any objections.</p>

      <p>To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication
      decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus
      (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period
      of 10 working days. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the
      resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>

      <p>All decisions made by the Working Group SHOULD be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes
      available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.</p>

      <p>This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C
      Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document
      requires.</p>
