        <h2>Scope</h2>

          <p>This group is chartered to develop specifications for the representation of timed text in media.</p>

          <p>Timed text means text synchronized with other timed media, e.g. audio and video (2D, 3D, 360ยบ, AR and VR), and
          includes captions, subtitles, described video (aka video/audio description), karaoke lyrics, etc.</p>
    
          <p>These specifications are intended to be used across the workflow from authoring to end-user presentation, and for both prepared
          and live applications.</p>

        <p>More detailed milestones and updated publication schedules are available on the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/wiki/TimedText/Publications">group publication status page</a>.</p>

        <p><i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of the charter approval. <i>Expected completion</i> indicates when the deliverable is projected to become a Recommendation, or otherwise reach a stable state.</p>

<div id="normative">
  <h3>New Normative Specifications</h3>

  <p>The Working Group intends to develop the following new W3C normative specifications:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt class="spec">
      Profiles of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml2/">Timed Text Markup Language 2 (TTML2)</a>, and related specifications.
    </dt>

    <dd>
      <p>TTML2 can be used to support a variety of applications.
        Each such application typically uses an associated subset of TTML2 features, known as a profile.
        Similarly other related specifications may govern such applications,
        for example by setting performance or complexity constraints.
      </p>
      <p>An example application would be the authoring and exchange of
        timed text documents that support audio description or dubbing workflows. Such an application might define text associated with media at
        various times, in one or more languages, as well as
        any directives for rendering that text into audio.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="webvtt" class="spec">
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/">WebVTT: The Web Video Text Tracks Format</a>
    </dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This specification defines WebVTT, the Web Video Text Tracks format. Its main use is for marking up
      external text track resources in connection with the HTML &lt;track&gt; element. WebVTT files provide
      captions or subtitles for video content, and also text video descriptions <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/">[MAUR]</a>, chapters for content navigation,
      and more generally any form of metadata that is time-aligned with audio or video content.</p>
    </dd>

  <h3>Existing Normative Specifications</h3>

  <p>The Working Group MAY update its <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/TimedText/Publications">previously
  published Normative Specifications</a>.</p>
</div>

	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
	  <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each
      normative feature is expected to meet the requirements set out in
      <a href="#advancement">ยง3.1</a> to demonstrate adequate
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">implementation experience</a>.</p>

    <p>Each Recommendation-track Technical Report:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>SHOULD contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</li>
      <li>SHOULD have an associated testing plan, starting from the earliest drafts.</li>
      <li>SHOULD contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways that features defined in the Technical Report can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</li>
      <li>SHOULD address the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media Accessibility User Requirements</a></li>
      <li>SHOULD contain a section discussing interoperability with previous versions, if any, of the Technical Report, and other relevant specifications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To promote interoperability, all normative changes made to Technical Reports SHOULD have associated <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.</p>
    <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
    <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts. To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.</p>
    <p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
    <section id="advancement">
    <h3>Requirements for advancing the maturity level of features</h3>
    <p>Within the requirements of the Process each new normative feature
    will be considered as ready to advance to a higher maturity level if
    its implementability has been demonstrated.</p>
    <p>When considering suitability to advance any feature beyond
    Candidate Recommendation, at least two factors of verification
    MUST be demonstrated, which may come from any of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Presentation implementation</li>
      <li>Content</li>
      <li>Validating implementation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, a feature MAY be advanced beyond Candidate Recommendation
    if it has been demonstrated to be implementable on the basis of a single
    open source implementation that successfully processes content from an
    independent source.</p>

        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed Text Working Group home page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most <a href="https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/">Timed Text Working Group</a> teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>This Working Group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list public-tt@w3.org (<a href=
          "http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-tt/">archive</a>) or <a id="public-github" href=
          "https://github.com/w3c/">GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this
          work.</p>
    
          <p>The Working Group MAY use a Member-confidential mailing list member-tt@w3.org (<a href=
          "http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-tt/">archive</a>) for administrative purposes and, at the discretion
          of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests
          such a discussion.</p>

      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
